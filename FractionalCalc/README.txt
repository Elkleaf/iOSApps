Fractional Calculator!

This fractional calculator was created, compiled, and run on Xcode5. This calculator can do basic arithmetic on whole numbers, fractions, or mixed fractions. It cannot preform the square root, and this exception is handled properly when the square root button is pressed. There is no overflow checking, so the user should be aware that inputing really big numbers can potentially cause it to crash. This calculator does not draw the fractions on the screen nor does it take in a whole expression to evaluate. You may enter only 1 number(either a mixed fraction, whole number, regular fraction or improper fraction) at a time and then press the desired operation you wish to preform. To input a mixed fraction , simply enter the whole number first, then press the numerator button and when you are done entering the numbers for the numerator press the denominator button.

run using the 4inch display.
