Program:
This is a simple Discount Calculator. The textfields that contain USD amounts can go up to $999,999,999.99. The fields that contain percentages can go up to 999% but should not exceed 100% or else the program will have undesired results. the Price textfield should not be entered with a negative value or the program will have undesired results. It is something I will fix in the future.

I wrote and tested this program using Xcode and the project builder and compiler in Xcode. You need to run this program using a 4-inch retina display settings in X-code for the iPhone.
This program completes the requirements needed for it. You should be able to run this program in Xcode as is, without adding any external files or dependencies.
