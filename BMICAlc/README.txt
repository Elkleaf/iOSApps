Program:
This is a simple BMI calculator. It has the option of calculating the BMI using metrics or US standard.

I wrote and tested this program using Xcode and the project builder and compiler in Xcode. You need to run this program using a 4-inch retina display settings in X-code for the iPhone.
This program completes the requirements needed for it. You should be able to run this program in Xcode as is, without adding any external files or dependencies.
