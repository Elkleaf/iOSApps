Mass Transit App!

This app has 4 tabs. 2 of the tabs will display all the routes for OCTA and the Metrolink transit agencies. The remaining 2 tabs will display PDFs of the OCTA and Metrolink transit maps. When you choose a route from the list, you will be taken to another Table view of all the stops on that route if there are some. When you click on the stop, you will be taken to a detailed view of the stop which shows the stop on a map and displays the coordinates.

run using the 3.5inch display.
