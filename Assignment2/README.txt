Program:
this program takes a list of words “words.txt” and finds the largest set of anagrams in that list

make sure the “words.txt” is in the same folder that the executable is in. If it is not or you can not find the executable, then you will have to run the program once so it will create the executable, and you can go to the products folder in the Xcode project manager and locate the executable. Right click on the executable and choose “show in finder” and add the “words.txt “ file to that folder. The project should work just buy executing it.

the output of the program is:

The largest set of anagrams contains 11 words: 
angor
argon
goran
grano
groan
nagor
Orang
orang
organ
rogan
Ronga
